## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a CS engineering student focused on **Cloud and DevOps engineering**, with hands-on experience designing and deploying **AWS-based architectures**.

I build **infrastructure-first projects** that demonstrate:
- Real cloud design decisions
- Scalability & security considerations
- Production-style deployments

Alongside cloud work, I have a strong foundation in **modern web development**, which helps me design and deploy **end-to-end systems** rather than isolated components.

## ☁️ Cloud & DevOps Skills

### AWS
- EC2 (Linux-based deployments)
- VPC (public/private subnets, route tables, IGW, NAT Gateway)
- S3 (static hosting, asset storage)
- CloudFront (global CDN)
- RDS (PostgreSQL, Multi-AZ aware architecture)
- Security Groups & NACLs
- Load Balancer concepts (ALB)

### DevOps & Infrastructure
- Docker (containerized apps & services)
- Linux system administration
- Nginx (reverse proxy, static hosting)
- Environment-based configuration
- Basic CI/CD concepts
- Infrastructure documentation & diagrams
